# ugrad_thesis
Most of the code that I wrote for my undergraduate thesis, and a pdf of the thesis itself.

Note that a lot of the files in the Processing_GUI folder were written by others as publicly available matlab code, as indicated in the appropriate file. All of the files with a captial letter in the name in that folder were written by me. In other folders, the only file that wasn't written by me is randraw.m.

Also fair warning, some of it may or may not be commented or coded that well: I wrote a lot of files quickly in the wrapup to my thesis.
