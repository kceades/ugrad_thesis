# ugrad_thesis
Most of the code that I wrote for my undergraduate thesis, and a pdf of the thesis itself.

Note that a lot of the files in the Processing_GUI folder were written by others as publicly available matlab code, as indicated in the appropriate file. All of the files with a captial letter in the name in that folder were written by me. In other folders, the only file that wasn't written by me is randraw.m.
